To store characters we can use character type. 

`char` is the keyword to do this.

You should type the character between two single quotation marks. `(‘A’)`

The `string` is the keyword to store many characters. 

You should type the `string` between two double quotation marks. `(“”)` 

```java

package variables.Variables;

public class TheCharecter {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        char character = 'A';

        System.out.println(character);

        String name = "Dedunu";
        String surname = "Uduwewelage";

        System.out.println(name + " " + surname);
        
    }


}
```
