Print line function `println()`

This function will print some words in the output box.

This function came with open and close parentheses.

In Java, a line of the text contained by two double quotation marks. `“”` Its call `string`.

Inside these parentheses with inside two double quotation marks, you should type what you want to print.  Then run the program.

```java
package com.company;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        /*
            this is a sample text
         */
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
}
```
