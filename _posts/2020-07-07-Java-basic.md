Java comments : Java comments are for the human to read. You can add additional information about your program between `/*` and `*/` symbols. Those are not interpreted by the compiler.

```java
package com.company;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
	// write your code here
        /*
        
         */
    }
}
```

The `main()` function is the starting point of the Java program.

Carrier braces describe where the class starting and where the class end.

```java
package com.company;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
	// write your code here
    }
}
```

Should end every instruction with a semicolon. `;` 

Parth to the function connect with a dot. `.`

```java
System.out.println();

java.lang.Math.pow();
```
