Let's break down prompt.

```
morty@c137:~$

morty     - user name
c137      - computer name
:         - separator
~         - home directory
$         - represent regular user
```

The root user's prompt:

```
root@c137:~#
```

`#` sign for root user, this is not the root of the file system `/`. This is an user account with all the privileges.
